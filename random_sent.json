        "one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study .",
        "fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis .",
        "this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy .",
        "a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore .",
        "our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) .",
        "most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb .",
        "it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician .",
        "it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist .",
        "patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe .",
        "prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe .",
        "our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery .",
        "other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery .",
        "however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) .",
        "hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population .",
        "in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe .",
        "our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte .",
        "co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively .",
        "both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte .",
        "venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study",
        ", venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients .",
        "perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors .",
        "overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) .",
        "a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered .",
        "this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt .",
        "the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry .",
        "this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites .",
        "most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week .",
        "we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively .",
        "the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist .",
        "bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry ,",
        "anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population .",
        "the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds .",
        "thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal .",
        "dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission .",
        "the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte .",
        "over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al .",

        "our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 .",
        "this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted .",
        "although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 .",
        "our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies .",
